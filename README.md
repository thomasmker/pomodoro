# Pomodoro
A pomodoro timer using tkinter

## Introduction
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they haveâ€”rather than against it. 
Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. 
After four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes. 

So this desktop app helps to keep track of these intervals.
